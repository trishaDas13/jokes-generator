<h2>JavaScript code description: </h2>
It selects various elements on the web page and stores them in variables:

joke: Represents a paragraph element where jokes will be displayed.
btn: Represents an array of buttons used for different actions.
body: Represents the body element of the HTML document.
opt: An options object containing headers for making an API request.
It defines an object named opt that contains headers with an API key for making HTTP requests. It also specifies the HTTP request method as 'GET'.

The code provides three main functionalities triggered by button clicks:

a. Generating Jokes:

When the first button (btn[0]) is clicked, it changes the text inside the joke element to an emoji (ðŸ˜‚) temporarily.
After a short delay (500 milliseconds), it sends an asynchronous GET request to the 'https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/dadjokes' API endpoint with the specified headers and method.
It then retrieves a joke from the API response (assuming it's in the format { jokes: [{ joke: '...'}] }) and updates the text inside the joke element with the retrieved joke.

b. Sharing Jokes on WhatsApp:

When the second button (btn[1]) is clicked, it opens a WhatsApp sharing dialog.
The content to be shared is the text of the joke element.

c. Toggling Dark Mode and Light Mode:

When the third button (btn[2]) is clicked, it toggles the CSS class 'dark' on the body element.
This class is used to switch the page between dark and light mode, where different CSS rules define the styling for each mode.

<h2>Summary: </h2>
In summary, this code allows users to click a button to generate jokes from an API, share jokes on WhatsApp, and switch between dark and light modes for the web page's appearance. It demonstrates how to make API requests, update elements in response to user actions, and toggle styles for different modes.
